# bridger
Construct sheets of hands for playing bridge.

It also allows parameters to be given so that hands likely to open in a specific way are produced.  This is to aid practice and teaching.

Functions to be added:
1) Allow vulnerability to factor into the hand selection,
2) Hands with different selection criteria.  At present all hands in one set have the same condition.
3) Allow seperation of print-outs of hands for different seats. i.e. North hands and corresponding South hands on seperate sheets.
4) Allow additional parameters, e.g. probable overcalls by opponents,
