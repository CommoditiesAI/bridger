Construct PDFs of hands for playing bridge.

It also allows parameters to be given so that hands are likely to be opened in a specific way are produced. This is to aid practice and teaching.

Base system is Benji Acol with weak no trump, but these can be amended by setting point ranges and suit lengths.

Outputs are in the form of PDFs with up to six hands per page. The outputs can be customised to show only one hand (N, E, S or W) or all the hands.

Additional data, such as high-card point count and suit length points are included for those hands shown. An indication of losing trick count (either the original system or the modified system) can also be added.

Functions to be added:

1) Allow vulnerability to factor into the hand selection,
2) Extend additional parameters, e.g. response by partner to an opening bid, or overcall by opponents
