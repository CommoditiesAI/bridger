## Test environments
Tried testing on Linux and MacOS using Travis CI, but failed due to problems with package::pdftools, not this package.
    "(converted from warning) installation of package ‘pdftools’ had non-zero exit status"
I'm unclear how to resolve:

I don't have access to machines running macOS or Ubuntu to test on these environments
