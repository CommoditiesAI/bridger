printHands(
  ids = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{ids}{The ids of hands to be generated}

\item{seats}{The seats of the hands in ids, i.e. the seat which gives the requested conditions, this will become South when printed}

\item{handType}{The type of hand required, default is 'any'.  Alternatives include, '4441', 'strong', ...}

\item{num}{The number of hands wanted}

\item{outputSeats}{Character code of required seats, "N", "E", "S", "W" and "F" for the full hand NB "ALL" equivalent to "FNEWS"}

\item{saveOutputDir}{If FALSE (Default) will save to temporary directory, or specify a directory, e.g. "c:/temp/bridger"}

\item{...}{Other variables that may be passed when selecting compliant hands}
}
\value{
Text message, confirming completion and specifying location of PDF outputs
}
\description{
Produce a page of bridge hands as a PDF.  Each page can hold up to 6 hands, and can show all seats or one of the seats can be selected
through the 'outputSeats' parameter.

\itemize{
  \item{"FULL" or "F"}{ - Show all seats.}
  \item{"N" / "E" / "S" / "W"}{ - Show only the specified seats on separate outputs. e.g. "NS" to generate North and South seats.}
  \item{"ALL" or "A"}{ - Equivalent to "FNEWS", i.e. Separate pages of each of the four seats, and one page with all seats.}
  }

  In all cases, only point counts for the selected seats will be visible.

  The output PDFs will be saved to a temporary directory, but a directory can be specified in the 'saveOutput' parameter.

# Produce a hand showing all seats and save them to 'c:/temp/bridger' directory

\donttest{
# Produce a page of 6 hands likely to open with a 3-level preempt, only showing the South seat
printHands(handType = "preempt3", num = 6, outputSeats = "S")

# Produce the specified hands, showing all seats
printHands(ids = c(500, 501, 502), seats = c("E", "W", "S"), outputSeats = "FULL")
