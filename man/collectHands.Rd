\usage{
collectHands(handType = "opener", num = 6, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{handType}{Type of hands wanted}

\item{num}{Number of hands requested}

\item{...}{Other parameters to be passed to the find_ functions, e.g. HC_low, cardLen_low}
}
\value{
Tibble - One line per requested hand with hand ID, seat position and type of hand
}
\description{
Returns a list of hands that fit a requirement.  Simple hands will most often give the required bids.
  Complex hands, where a subsequent bid is made, may not fit the requirements, as other bids by opponents or partner
  may be preferable to the desired bidding pattern.
}
\note{
Each of the handTypes is a standard set of parameters.  For example "NT" (alias "balanced") allows 12-14 points, a single doubleton
and no 5-card majors and no 6-card minor.  To change these parameters then optional parameters can be passed through the "...".
The most common changes will be to specify the low and high high-card range and the shortest allowed suit and longest allowed.
These are "HC_low" and "HC_high", "cardLen_low" and "cardLen_high" respectively.
